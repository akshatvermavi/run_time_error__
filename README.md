## About EDPAL

**EDPAL** is one of the worldâ€™s largest communities for students across all grades, subjects, and geographical locations. It is designed to provide students with a platform to connect with peers who share similar educational backgrounds, access a wealth of subject-related information, receive career guidance, and find resources that help them learn more and grow further.

### Why EDPAL?

In every corner of society, there are students who may not know each other but should be connected. While existing platforms focus on connecting teachers and students, there is a gap for a student-centric platform where the presence of teachers is optional. **EDPAL** fills this gap by allowing students to:

- Share knowledge and educational materials.
- Post and access new educational content, courses, and school-related activities.
- Receive notes and updates from schools and teachers.

### Benefits for Students:

A student, once on-boarded, would receive:

- **Knowledge Sharing Platform**: An environment where knowledge grows by sharing, allowing students to exchange notes, study materials, and insights.
- **Peer Connections**: Opportunities to connect with fellow students studying similar subjects or within a specific distance.
- **Resource Exchange**: A platform to receive and share notes, and to store certificates and achievements.
- **Appreciation and Motivation**: Receive appreciation notes from teachers that can be valuable in future educational endeavors.

### Benefits for Schools:

Schools that onboard with EDPAL gain several advantages:

- **Enhanced Communication**: A platform to share important announcements, updates, and results with students and parents.
- **Student Appreciation**: A channel to acknowledge students' efforts and achievements, motivating them to excel.
- **Surveys and Feedback Collection**: Tools to assess students' understanding of topics and gather valuable feedback.
- **Psychological Insights**: Features that help schools understand students' psychological states to better support their educational journey.

Most of these features are available to students and schools at no extra cost, making EDPAL a valuable and accessible educational platform.
